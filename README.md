# Tax Burden Distribution Analysis - Competition Project

This project was prepared for an analytical competition.
This is an educational project, data and scenarios are fictional.

The analysis focuses on the distribution of tax burdens in the fictional country **Fiskalia**, based on micro-level tax data.
The main goal is to examine how different income sources and tax regimes affect redistribution outcomes.
