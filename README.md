# Tax Burden Distribution Analysis - Competition Project

## Project Overview

This project was prepared for an analytical competition.
The analysis focuses on the distribution of tax burdens in the fictional country **Fiskalia**, based on micro-level tax data.

The main goal is to examine how different income sources and tax regimes affect redistribution outcomes.

## Scope of Analysis

- Government revenue calculations for three tax types: progressive PIT, flat PIT, and capital gains tax.
- Redistribution analysis using empirical/theoretical tax wedge charts, effective tax rates by income decile, and progressivity assessment.
- Two reform scenarios (rate change and allowance plus threshold change), including effects on budget revenue and social groups.

## Tech Stack

- Language: `R`
- Libraries: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `gridExtra`, `kableExtra`, `bookdown`
- Report format: `RMarkdown -> PDF`
